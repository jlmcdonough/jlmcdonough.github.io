                                    <h3>January 2024 - July 2024</h3>
                                        <p>In the middle of January, Fortinet had officially acquired Concourse Labs
                                            (renamed to FortiCSPM) as well as all current employees. At Fortinet, we
                                            still continued to maintain and push small updates to the previous product,
                                            while beginning to work on a new, joint product. Fortinet had a similar
                                            product to the one we had at Concourse Labs, but with some holes that we
                                            fixed and vice versa. After we converted our pipelines to Jenkins and
                                            transferred all the repositories to a central place, Fortinet decided to
                                            stop pursing this path altogether. </p>

                                    <h3>January 2022 - January 2024</h3>
                                        <p>Starting at the beginning of the new year, I began work as an associate
                                            software engineer working on the core (backend) team.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Concourse Lab's product was a software that allowed security-as-code. With
                                            both built-in and user created "policies", we were able to scan a user's
                                            AWS, Azure, or GCP cloud accounts. While also being able to evaluate
                                            Ansible, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Terraform, and other
                                            Infrastructure-as-Code file types against the same "policies". For found
                                            "misconfigurations", we would create "violations" to alert the user of such
                                            findings, so they can go in and resolve it themselves.
                                            <br><br>
                                            There I work alongside a team to tackle backend tasks while also working
                                            closely with members of other teams to accomplish the goals set out.
                                            Being a relatively smaller team, I am able to work with numerous different
                                            technologies and facets across the product, giving lots of exposure and
                                            allowing me to learn from a wide array of areas. Mainly a Spring Boot
                                            project written in Java and built with Bazel, but also expanded into writing
                                            some Mutiny-Quarkus gRPC services written in Java and built with Gradle.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Was also able to do some work in other languages as we had a couple
                                            Go, Scala, and Python services and jobs. Was also able to work in numerous
                                            places, such as creating ci/cd pipelines for Gitlab using yaml,
                                            implementing helm charts to aid with Kubernetes deploys, creating protos
                                            for the gRPC services and common objects, working with a PostreSQL database,
                                            and AWS and GCP services, mainly surrounding topics, queues, and buckets
                                            for queue driven services. I was also able to design and implement an
                                            automatic Postman test suites to run on a scheduled basis, as well as
                                            manually before and after each release to ensure all our endpoints were
                                            working as expected.</p>

                                    <h3>June 2021 - August 2021</h3>
                                        <p>After accepting an internship at Amazon through the Amazon Propel Program
                                            (APP), I worked as a Software Development Engineer on a Finance Technology
                                            team. As part of the APP, the bootcamp was four weeks long to provide
                                            extensive teaching on many of the available Amazon Web Services and adapting
                                            the interns to the development process and practices that all SDEs at
                                            Amazon abide by. Throughout and after the bootcamp, I was put on a team
                                            within the FinTech division where I worked on a project with the help of a
                                            mentor and the team. This project gave me the ability to take a project from
                                            inception to production. It encompassed creating a new UI and then
                                            implementing various different services and APIs to do its job, which served
                                            as a tool and quality of life improvement for both the vendors that use the
                                            service and the developers alike. Upon completion, a presentation to the
                                            FinTech team was made demonstrating the work I have done. The internship
                                            also provided me the ability to work both remote and the opportunity to
                                            travel to Seattle to work at Amazon headquarters for some time.</p>

                                    <h3>Product Security Engineer Intern</h3>
                                    <h3>May 2019 - August 2019</h3>
                                        <p>In the summer after my freshman year of college, I served as a Product
                                            Security Engineer Intern at BD in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. BD is a
                                            medical technology company that makes and sells these devices. The role of
                                            the Product Security Engineering Team is to ensure that the patient's
                                            personally identifiable information and protected health information remains
                                            secure. Essentially, they make sure the devices are secure and are in
                                            constant update of new patches and exposed vulnerabilities. I was given a
                                            few different tasks to work on. The main project I worked on was bringing
                                            KeePass to BD associates. Although this task does not really fall under the
                                            scope of Product Security, this project was done to unify Product Security
                                            and the internal security team. I was part of this small team and created
                                            the user guide and documentation for KeePass, as well as providing a demo
                                            to a pilot group of 300 members, the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief
                                            Security Officer. I also created a user guide for CylancePROTECT, an AI
                                            based security solution. In this guide, I discussed the benefits of Cylance
                                            and how to install and implement it with best practices. This guide is to
                                            be sent to users of BD devices. The two projects I did that were focused
                                            around Product Security were the hardening of a KIOSK and Internet
                                            Information Services. For these two projects, I had to teach myself
                                            PowerShell so that I could create a hardening, verification, and rollback
                                            scripts. The hardening scripts would make sure the KIOSK or IIS would meet
                                            BD's secure requirements. The verification scripts would ensure that all
                                            requirements were met and the rollback would revert the hardening changes.
                                            Along with the scripts, I had to create a user guide explaining what the
                                            need for KIOSK and IIS hardening and how to implement the scripts.
                                            The KIOSK project was sent to various business units and was
                                            presented on a call to various executives.</p>

                                            of people and this is a step in getting me towards comfortability. I have to
                                            be willing to interact with these people along with being knowledgeable
                                            enough about the school so that I can guarantee a correct answer to any
                                            questions they throw at me.</p>

                                        <p>When possible on the weekends, would assist staff with morning cleaning in
                                            either the cattery or the kennels. Would care for the cats and dogs by
                                            cleaning their spaces as well as providing fresh bedding, toys, food, and
                                            water. Would get some interaction with the animals while cleaning.</p>

                                        <p>Camp New Day is a week-long summer camp for developmentally delayed adults.
                                            I attended as a camp counselor and my job is to live with and aid the
                                            campers through day-to-day activities. The camp and fellow counselors set up
                                            daily activities and helped these individuals participate in them. As a
                                            counselor, we also helped the campers in getting ready for meals and sleep.
                                            I attended Camp New Day as part of my senior service project for high
                                            school. It seemed like a good way for me to positively impact the lives of
                                            those who may be struggling. This was an amazing experience as I learned how
                                            to work with and care for developmentally delayed adults because they can
                                            act a little different and sporadic at times. This trip was a week-long
                                            venture into the unknown, and I am super glad that I participated in it.</p>

                                    <h3>December 2006 - December 2019</h3>
                                        <p>Every December, about two weeks before Christmas, the Elizabeth PBA hosts an
                                            event with the Children's Specialized Hospital. The event, Shop With a Cop,
                                            allows for children of the Children's Specialized Hospital in Mountainside,
                                            New Jersey to go Christmas shopping for family and friends. Ordinarily,
                                            these kids are not given much independence and are not able to go and pick
                                            out their own gifts for family. This event allows them to do that. I
                                            volunteer in all possible aspects. There is a charity run before the
                                            shopping event in which I arrive early to help set up the course as well as
                                            give water to runners. For the shopping event, I help set up and clean up,
                                            as well as going shopping with some of the kids and serve them lunch. In the
                                            end, it is a long 12-hour day that I look forward to each year.</p>
