        <h4> CYBERSECURITY ESCAPE ROOM</h4>

			<p> At Marist, students are required to complete a capping course in their field of study prior to
				graduation. Because I am majoring in both cybersecurity and software development, there would normally
				be two projects to be completed. But since my cybersecurity team was to be paired with a software
				development team, I was given the unique opportunity to work on both teams to complete a project. We
				were tasked with designing and producing an escape room game. The purpose is to gamify cybersecurity
				concepts such that it would be fun for students to learn. For the cybersecurity team, I am working to
				create the story, dialogue, and identifying which topics we want to teach the user. Using Yu-kai Chou's
				gamification and octalysis framework, we were able to make sure our game was more than just a
				learning simulator and provided the user with many core game features. The cybersecurity team are the
				designers while the software development team are the implementers. Using Unity, we created a 3D world
				where the user can walk around the escape room (using a custom-made node-based movement system),
				solving various puzzles and playing mini-games to have a good time while learning about cybersecurity.
				Due to our success in producing this game, we were chosen to represent the computer science department
				at a Marist College Open House. With the help of our professors and sponsor, we will continue to exist
				moving forward. There are plans to take part in the Mid-Hudson Regional Business Plan Competition in the
				spring of 2022 as well as gain funding from our sponsor to support this project. The game, titled ARI,
				has its own<a href=https://aricyberthink.com/>website</a> where you can download and play the game
				yourself.</p>

			<p> The fall 2021 Operating Systems course is utilizing TypeScript to create our own operating system. This
				massive tasks is designed to reinforce the teachings in this course as well as the previously taken
				Computer Organization and Architecture. The previous summer, my Amazon project dealt a lot in
				TypeScript and having some difficulties there, I am glad that I now have a project that is forcing me to
				get better with it instead of creating my own individual one. Upon completion of this course, I had a
				functional operating system that can allow users to run up to three programs all while properly managing
				memory and other resources.</p>

        <h4> POLOLU ROBOT</h4>
		<img src="/images/robot.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Robotics>view</a> </p>
			<p> My spring 2021 robotics course involved various labs that were conducted throughout the entire semester.
				All the labs served as stepping stones towards the final project, which was to have the robot navigate
				an obstacle course. The initial labs were designed to teach the student how the robot works by having
				the robot move a certain distance forwards and backwards. As the semester moved along, an ultrasonic
				sensor and servo were added to the robot to give it more functionality. Future labs included getting the
				robot to follow a wall as well as avoiding obstacles with the help of a PID controller. These new
				features, combined with the default robot, allowed us to have the robot start on a specific point, and
				end on another specific point in space, all while avoiding the obstacles. The robot used in for this
				course was a <a href=https://www.pololu.com/product/3737>Pololu 3pi+ 32U4 Standard Edition</a>.</p>

		<h4> INFECTION SIMULATION</h4>

  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/Infection%20Simulation>view</a> </p>
			<p> The semester long project for the fall 2020 course of Algorithm Analysis and Design was to create a
				program to simulate the various testing protocols that would be employed for a widespread pandemic. As
				this course was taken in the midst of Covid-19, the purpose of this project was to compare different
				protocols. On campus, the testing protocol was to take twelve individual tests, pool them together, and
				then test the pool. If the pool returned a positive result, then all twelve individuals would be
				individually tested. To the class, the professor proposed the idea of groups of eight and if a positive
				test was found, divide the group into two smaller groups of four to identify which half (or both)
				contained a positive result. Whichever (or both) group(s) tested positive would result in those four
				(or eight) individuals being individually tested. In my simulation, I allowed for custom user input so
				the user could modify variables such as infection and group size and even taking into account test
				inaccuracy (among others). Some of the findings in the simulation could be found in a report that was
				submitted along with the code which explained the whole process, each code segmented, and some test
				cases. </p>

		<h4> IOTA</h4>
		<img src="/images/lang.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/iota>view</a> </p>
			<p> To enforce the concepts learned throughout the fall 2020 course of Theory of Programming Language, the
				class was divided into groups of four students to create their own programming language that would be
				built upon the Racket Programming Language, which is built upon Scheme. Throughout this project, I had
				to both create the documentation which contained the language overview, formal syntax, and operational
				semantics and grammars. Using this rules that were defined in the documentation, I then had to translate
				this to usable code. The goal we were trying to achieve in this project was to remove some of the
				features we did not like in when coding work for this class, as well as adding features that would have
				been useful. One of the more annoying issues with Racket is the use of parenthesis and how easy it could
				be to get lost. Another would be the way if statements would work and the lack of other control
				functions (i.e. looping). Iota attempted to fix some of that. Print lines and useful mathematical and
				comparison operators were also added. The end product were some test cases demonstrating all the
				functionality that we had implemented and a presentation explaining the documentation, code, and
				test cases to the class. </p>

		<h4> FOX N FOUND</h4>

  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/FoxNFound>view</a> </p>
			<p> Over the course of the Software Development II class, we were tasked with creating a lost and found
				database with a website to access it. The website was coded in php and the database in MySQL. With the
				help of a local Abyss Web Server, the website can be run and the database modified from it. Essentially,
				the website allows users to add lost item data and the admins have the ability to add and modify data
				in all tables. Users can report lost items as the founder of the item, or the person who lost it.
				Admins can then go in and match a lost item to a found item, indicating that it has been returned to its
				rightful owner. In the event a new building is added, or a new admin user needs to be given proper
				permissions, the admins can do add to the proper tables from the website.</p>

		<h4> STUDENT PLANNER</h4>
		<img src="/images/sp.jpg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/System-Design>view</a> </p>
			<p> The first project of the spring 2020 Systems Design course tasked teams to build an application
				prototype. My group decided on making a planner application that would allow students to become more
				organized. One of the goals would allow professors to upload a syllabus directly to the app, such that
				all the assignments that are required from the students would be put into the calendar for them. The app
				would give students various calendar and task views as well as filtering assignment by type, professor,
				or date. The screens were designed and made using inVision and the prototype can be viewed
				<a href=https://invis.io/SCW9LP72NPX>here</a>  </p>

		<h4> DATABASE DESGIN</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/149/149749.svg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/Database%20Design>view</a> </p>
			<p> For the fall 2019 semester, my database class' semester project was to create a database, using Oracle's
				SQL Developer, and then create data for it. With the data, there were ten different types of queries
				that needed to be filled out. The data I used came from PC game, Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. Almost
				all the data is real values from within the game and its professional scene. The end product was a
				report containing the model description, ER-Diagram, table and key definitions, justification of third
				normal form, and the queries. </p>

		<h4> LAST STAND</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/45/45985.svg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/LastStand>view</a> </p>
			<p> For the fall 2018 semester, I was tasked with creating a text based adventure game, in the spirit of
				Zork. This game was to be built in Python and was a project that took the duration of the semester. My
				game is not too in-depth and is titled "Last Stand". It takes place in London in the middle of an
				epidemic. The player chooses a role out of a role list that will determine the strengths and weaknesses
				of the character. The ultimate goal is to gather the necessary supplies, avoid the gangs, and outlive
				the epidemic and hopefully return home. In the near future, I hope to return back to and make it much
				more random and add new events and customizability. </p>

		<h4> HALLWAY SIMULATOR</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/59/59809.svg" align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/HallwaySimulator>view</a></p>
			<p> Spring 2019 semester is the same sort of project as fall 2018, a text based adventure game except this
				one is in Java. The theme and requirements are provided by the professor and is more of a follow
				directions opposed to the complete creativity given in my previous work. The game has a simple GUI
				whilst prompting starting. Unlike the python alternative, this game also allows the user to "retrace"
				their moves as they can view the path they have taken upon completion. There is also a scoreboard
				present so the user can work to constantly improve their high score.</p>

		<h4> SPROUT CREEK FARMS</h4>

    		<p><a <a href=/pdf/bus100.pdf>view</a></p>
			<p> Also in the fall 2018 semester, I was part of a team in my business course that was required to bring
				forth a new idea and produce a business plan for Sprout Creek Farms in Poughkeepsie, New York. I served
				as the Operational Manager of the team along with the research and constructing of the business plan, I
				was responsible for the day-to-day tasks as well as making sure all the criteria was met, and we stayed
				on track. In the end, we found a way for the farm to license their cheeses with local wineries and
				brought forth an idea for a new organic chocolate line utilizing the leftover milk. </p>
