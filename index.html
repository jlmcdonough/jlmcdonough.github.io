											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p> I am a software engineer who previously worked at a startup called
											Concourse Labs, that was later acquired by Fortinet. There I worked as a
											backend software engineer, mainly working on Java services but as a small
											company, worked in many places other than just Java code. I was able to gain
											experience in other languages and tools as well as some infrastructure
											pieces.
											<br><br>
											My developer interests lie as close to the data. I was fortunate enough to
											work solely on backend and not have to do any frontend work in my
											professional career so far as I much prefer working with and creating
											endpoints and services to fetch and process data. While I do have some
											education and internship experience dealing with frontend, it is not my area
											of expertise.
											<br><br>
											As a side project, I am also working with a group of friends in an indie
											game development studio called
											<a href=https://www.kunehostudios.com/>Kuneho Studios</a>. There we are in
											the process of making our first title, Project Radiance - a multi-lane
											rhythm game with its own unique features, art, and music.
											<br><br>
											Other interests lie many in soccer and motorsport, both racing and
											photography (can see some

										<h2>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</h2>
										<h3><a href=https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/6JMQA9XZJU2D>view</a> </h3>
										<p>Have always had a passion for numbers and statistics. Not having room for any
											data science classes in my college curriculum did sadden me a bit. As a
											result looked towards various certificates to start to fill that desire.
											Through Google's Data Analytics course, I was able to learn about some
											analytical skills such as data cleaning, calculations, and visualizations
											with tools such as R, Tableau, and spreadsheets.
											<br><br>
											At the end of the course, they request you complete a capstone project,
											which is ultimately a case study on either a set of data they provide you
											or one that you have/find on your own. Using the data I've been recording
											through my discord bot, I made a report based on my counter-strike game data
											which can be viewed
											<a href=files/csgoStats.pdf>here</a>

										<p>While pursuing my cybersecurity degree, one of the courses offered was
											Introduction to Quantum Computer Algorithms and Programming. This piqued my
											interest and throughout the course learned about quantum computing
											algorithms, fundamentals, and programming (with Qiskit). Upon completing and
											passing this course, Marist issued a Quantum Computing Algorithms and
											Programming certificate. </p>
