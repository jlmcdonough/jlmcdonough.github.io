						<h2>About Me</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I am a software engineer who previously worked at a startup called Concourse Labs, which was
						later acquired by Fortinet. There I was employed as a backend software engineer, mainly working
						on Java services but as a small company, I worked in many places outside Java code. Through
						this, I gained experience in different languages and tools as well as some infrastructure pieces
						that allow me to better understand all the necessary components it takes to run a functioning
						software product.</p>

					<p>My developer interests lie close to the data. I was fortunate enough to not have to do any
						frontend work in my professional career so far. While I have some education and internship
						experience dealing with frontend, it is not my area of expertise. While I can pick it up if
						needed, working on a team strictly doing frontend does not interest me as much as backend tasks.
						I prefer working with and creating endpoints and services to fetch and process data. In a
						professional setting, Java and Python are the languages I have the most experience and comfort
						with, however, I am always open to learning new things. I enjoyed working with many different
						languages, tools, and processes during my time at Concourse Labs and will continue to do so in
						the future.</p>

					<p>As a side project, I am also working with friends in an indie game
						development studio called <a href=https://kunehostudios.com/>Kuneho
							Studios</a>. There, we are in the process of making our first title,
						Project Radiance - a multi-lane rhythm game with unique features, art, and music.</p>

					<p>Other interests lie mainly in soccer and motorsport, both racing and
						photography (can see some <a href=https://500px.com/p/jmcdonough?view=galleries>here</a>)</p>

					<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
					<p>Continued working on the same team with the same technologies that were used at Concourse Labs to

						well as doing reactive programming in other Mutiny Quarkus gRPC services built with Gradle. As
						it was a small company, also got experience in numerous other languages and places like ci/cd
						pipelines, Kubernetes and Helm charts, and AWS and GCP services.</p>

					<h2>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</h2>
					<h3><a href=https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/6JMQA9XZJU2D>view</a>
					</h3>
					<p>Have always had a passion for numbers and statistics. Not having room for any data science
						classes in my college curriculum did sadden me a bit. As a result, I looked towards various
						certificates to start to fill that desire. Through Google's Data Analytics course, I was able
						to learn about some analytical skills such as data cleaning, calculations, and visualizations
						with tools such as R, Tableau, and spreadsheets. </p>

					<p>At the end of the course, they request you complete a capstone project, which is ultimately a
						case study on either a set of data they provide you or one that you have/find on your own. Using
						the data I've been recording through my discord bot, I made a report based on my counter-strike
						game data which can be viewed <a href=files/csgoStats.pdf>here</a>.</p>

					</h3>
					<p>While pursuing my cybersecurity degree, one of the courses offered was Introduction to Quantum
						Computer Algorithms and Programming. This piqued my interest and throughout the course, I
						learned about quantum computing algorithms, fundamentals, and programming (with Qiskit). Upon
						completing and passing this course, Marist issued a Quantum Computing Algorithms and Programming
						certificate.</p>
