                                        <p> CMPT 475 is the first in a two-semester-sequence capping course for
                                        Computer Science majors. During the first semester, students study project
                                        management techniques, review oral presentation skills, study creating software
                                        documentation, assemble project teams (integrated teams including students in
                                        the ITS capping course), select a project client, perform analysis and design, and
                                        begin project implementation. The second semester is used to complete project
                                        implementation. The capping experience culminates with an oral presentation to
                                        the client and delivery of the software and its documentation.   </p>

                                        to recursive procedures will be solved. Sorting algorithms will be formally
                                        analyzed. Strategies of algorithm design such as backtracking, divide and
                                        conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy techniques will be emphasized. </p>
