								<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p>My name is Joseph McDonough, and am a software engineer. I graduated from Marist
									College with a bachelor's of science in computer science/software development as
									well as a major in cybersecurity and minors in information systems and information
									technology. Upon finishing my first semester senior year in January 2022, I was
									hired at Concourse Labs. While working and waiting until graduation, I took a
									semester of master's courses computer science/software development before stopping
									to focus solely on work. I worked at Concourse Labs until they were acquired by
									Fortinet in January 2024, where I worked until they stopped the product in favor of
									another in July 2024. </p>

								<p>With my first professional job being at a startup, I was given the opportunity very
									early on to explore different facets of a software company. I took a liking to the
									backend side of things as working with data is much more appealing than finding ways
									to display it. I have a tendency to prefer the functional aspects of things opposed
									to making them look nice on a user interface. While at Concourse Labs, I gained
									mainly professional Java experience, as well as some Go and Python. Was able to
									learn and work with the Spring Boot framework for REST services as well as reactive
									programming through Mutiny and Quarkus in gRPC services. Even picking up the things
									like Bazel and Gradle for a build system. Through my tenure there, I learned so much
									and got invaluable experience in many different areas that a software needs to
									survive. I am confident this knowledge will better prepare me for any future
									projects due to having a much greater understanding of what is needed on the larger
									scale.</p>

								<p>Having graduated as a double major, I did not get the opportunity to take any data
									science classes, which is something I do regret a bit. Statistics and numbers is
									something that had always fascinated me. Growing up, reading Moneyball by Michael
									Lewis was one of my biggest inspirations. The idea of using solely statistics and
									finding value in places that aren't visibly present was incredibly interesting to
									me. During college, I found motorsport and racing to scratch that itch, as there,
									every millimeter and every thousandth of a second matter. While all of that is still
									of interest to me today, I also took Google's Data Analytics Professional
									Certificate. Through this course, I learned about data analysis and cleaning, then
									visualization with R and Tableau. With these new skills, it enables me to do my own
									passion projects and maybe one day obtain a position where they can be useful.
								</p>

								<p>Despite my still large interest in math and numbers and the temptation of data
									science, computers and both software development and later cybersecurity took over.
									My enjoyment in computers came from when I discovered Counter-Strike: Global
									Offensive in 2013. There I made scripts (more like text files to execute single line
									console commands) to make my quality of life better in-game. I decided that I kind
									of liked to do that sort of stuff and would like to explore this side of computers.
                                	For high school, I attended Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey,
									and there I had the ability to take two computer science courses (AP Java and AP
									Computer Science Principles). These courses solidified my interest in working with
									computers and encouraged me to continue my education in the computer science
									field.</p>

								<p>In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work at BD for a 12-week internship
									where I worked on the Product Security Engineering Team in which I got to experience
									several different aspects of both software development and security practices. This
									experience further solidified my enjoyment in software development and cybersecurity.
									The summer of 2021 allowed me to build upon my software development studies. I got
									the chance to work at Amazon in Seattle, Washington for a finance technology team.
									There I was able to observe witness a project go from a thought to near production.
									Along the way, I was able to design, document, implement, and test changes, all
									while working with Amazon Web Services and other internal tools. </p>

								<p>Through my limited experiences so far, I find the most enjoyment working away from
									the user interface and in the backend. I enjoy working in services that read and
									write from a database and actually do something with the data. While I do have
									collegiate and internship knowledge in many different languages, I also favor those
									that I have already used in a professional settings. Java and Python are the most
									comfortable and I feel most confident to meet whatever requirements through them.</p>
