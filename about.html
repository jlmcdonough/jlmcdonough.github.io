								<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p>My name is Joseph McDonough, and I am a software engineer. I graduated from Marist College
									with a bachelor's of science in computer science/software development as well as a major
									in cybersecurity and minors in information systems and information technology.
									While working at Concourse Labs in January 2022, I took a semester of master's courses
									computer science/software development before stopping to focus solely on work. I worked
									at Concourse Labs until they were acquired by Fortinet in January 2024, where I worked
									until they killed the product in favor of another in July 2024. </p>
                                
                                <p>Growing up, I had a large fascination with baseball and numbers. I had read Moneyball
									by Michael Lewis when I was around 10 years old and was fascinated by the approach of
									statistics and sports. Despite my still large interest in math and numbers and the
									temptation of data science and analytics today, computers and both software development
									and later cybersecurity took over. My enjoyment in computers came from when I discovered
                                	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013. There I made scripts (more like text files
									to execute single line console commands) to make my quality of life better in-game and
									decided that I kind of liked to do that sort of stuff and would like to explore this
									side of computers.</p>
                                
                                <p>For high school, I attended Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey,
									and there I had the ability to take two computer science courses (AP Java and AP
									Computer Science Principles). These courses solidified my interest in working with
									computers and encouraged me to continue my education in the computer science field.
									In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work at BD for a 12-week internship
									where I worked on the Product Security Engineering Team in which I got to experience
									several different aspects of both software development and security practices. This
									experience further solidified my enjoyment in software development and cybersecurity.
									The summer of 2021 allowed me to build upon my software development studies. I got the
									chance to work at Amazon in Seattle, Washington for a finance technology team. There
									I was able to observe witness a project go from a thought to near production. Along
									the way, I was able to design, document, implement, and test changes, all while working
									with Amazon Web Services and other internal tools. </p>
