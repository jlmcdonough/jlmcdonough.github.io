								<h2>Discord Bot</h2>
                                <p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/discord-bot>view</a> </p>
								<p>Due to the coronavirus and not being able to work at the beginning of the summer, I decided to spend some of my time to further 
                                my use of python and figured creating a discord bot would be a fun and different way to go about this.  The part that was the most 
                                enjoyable and look to continue working on in the future is the mini casino games.  Currently, there is a dice game, blackjack, roulette, 
                                and a coin flip.  Using the knowledge from a previous database course, I was able to store all the information from the games played as well as 
                                the players.  Players have a currency and can bet against players or the bot in the various games.  For the sake of bragging rights, a leaderboard 
                                is also avaiable to be seen.  Using the bot and databases, I also added a way to import matches from various video games so that I could keep the 
                                data and when a significant of data is collected, I plan on doing another project with it.  This bot is a perpetual project such that when a 
                                decent idea for it comes along, will work towards implementing it.</p>

						        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
                                <p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/jlmcdonough.github.io>view</a> </p>
                                <p>A personal website to neatly organize and display my information. An easy to add on portfolio that I look to renovate every so often to keep working my front-end skills and learning new things. This iteration is forked from a repository that supports Stellar by HTML5Up. The previous website iteration was located <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/jlmcdonough.github.io-ARCHIVED>here</a></p>

                                <h2>InfiniteBlu Sales - PLANNED</h2>
                                <p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/InfiniteBlu>view</a> </p>
								<p>Using sales data from the 2020 and 2021 years, combined with the weather data in the location of the store, I am interested in trying to determine how the weather effects sales. The goal is to aid in determining how much of a certain item is immediately needed, based off past sales and the weather. For examples, how much more chlorine is sold when it is 90+ degrees outside for 3 straight days? This future project will allow me to explore the data analytics side that I have yet got a chance to and very much enjoy.</p>
                                
                                <span class="icon fa-spotify fa-5x"></span>
                                <h2>Spotify Stats - PLANNED</h2>
                                <p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/spotify-stats>view</a> </p>
								<p>Being an avid music listener, I am interested in a further breakdown of my listening history. This project will allow me to work with the Spotify API and gain experience using APIs and finding new ways to display this data. Another future project that allows me to combine the things that I love and display some very interesting information. Would like the ability for other people to either input their token or login to use. Would also like to transform this into my first Andriod app.</p>
